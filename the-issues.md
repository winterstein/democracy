# Why? What issues do we hope to address?

1. Conference struggles to cope with the volume of work. At the 2015 conference, most motions were never even debated.

2. The exclusive in-the-flesh conference and meetings based approach excludes and biases against sections of the party:
 - Parents, especially single parents (at the 2015 conference, there was no creche cover for the debate on childcare, 
 excluding the people most affected by these issues!)
 - Members whose jobs do not allow for regular attendance, especially amongst the lower paid: shift workers, 
 those on zero-hours contracts, those with two jobs.
 - Those with mental health issues and introverts, who may find Conferences off-putting.
 - Those for whom travel to Glasgow and Edinburgh is costly and time consuming.
 
Other issues:

 - More participation.
 - More agile decision making and process -- instead of waiting for an annual conference.
 - Better decision making through better tools.
