# Overview

We believe that using online voting and debate can radically improve democracy.

Looking beyond the party, we believe an improved democratic process would be very good for society, 
and the Scottish Green Party can act as a leader -- developing and proving ideas, and introducing 
them to the mainstream.

We propose starting with a simple change: ??fix the problem that Conference

## Other Approaches

### Delegative aka Liquid Democracy

Advantages:

 - Allows people to be counted even if they can't engage in the voting. 
 - Supports offline voters.

Disadvantages:

 - More complex -- let's start simple!
 - Celebrity voting power. "Celebrity" members soak up the apathetic vote, 
 which gives undue power to a handful of people. This could be addressed by capping the votes any one delegate can have.

Note: Through staged voting (e.g. monthly) with notifications, it should be possible to 
have a direct democracy approach which only requires a low investment of time.

### Streamline Conference

To help Conference cover more motions, debate could be reduced and amendments from the floor could be blocked. 
However this would make things less open and democratic.
